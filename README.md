<h1>Oral Lesions Detection APP</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model (CNN) for Oral Lesions Dtection.The model is trained on Dataset, hosted on Kaggle.

<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Upload an Image: Simply upload a clear image of the oral lesion you want to analyze. Our intuitive interface makes the process seamless.</li>

<li>Click Predict: Once the image is uploaded, hit the 'Predict' button, and our advanced deep learning model goes to work.</li>

<li>Receive Informed Analysis: Within moments, receive a detailed analysis of the lesion, including whether it's benign or malignant, along with confidence levels for the prediction.</li>
</ul>
